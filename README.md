## 👋 Hi, I'm Avril

I'm a software developer with a strong interest in backend development,  
where I enjoy designing clean, scalable, and well-structured systems.  
At the same time, I believe frontend matters too, and I like building complete solutions that connect solid logic with good user experiences.

I'm always curious about how things work under the hood and enjoy learning new technologies, improving my skills, and applying best practices to real-world projects.

### 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Backend:** Java (Spring Boot), Node.js, NestJS  
- **Frontend:** TypeScript, React, JavaScript, Next.js, HTML, CSS, Tailwind  
- **Database:** PostgreSQL, Oracle  
- **Tools:** Git, Docker, Figma  

### ☕ Fun facts
- I enjoy reading
- I love coffee  
- Constantly learning and experimenting with new technologies  
- I like learning new languages (who knows where we’ll end up in the future)
